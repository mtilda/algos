# Pyramid Sum

### Challenge

> Write an algorithm that takes in an array of numbers representing the base of a pyramid. The function should return a 2D array representing a complete pyramid with the given base. To construct a level of the pyramid, we take the sum of adjacent elements of the level below.
> ```
> # For example, the base [1, 4, 6] gives us the following pyramid
> #     15
> #   5   10
> # 1   4    6
> ```

### Example I/O

```
input: { 1, 4, 6 }
output: { {15}, {5, 10}, {1, 4, 6} }
```
```
input: { 3, 7, 2, 11 }
output: { {41}, {19, 22}, {10, 9, 13}, {3, 7, 2, 11} }
```
